## Richard Moss

Digital Nomad and avid technologist, I have worked on a variety of projects with a diverse range of people, crossing both languages and continents. As a speaker of five languages and counting, I've been told I'm a great communicator and motivating to work with. 

I recently decided to take the plunge into the web-develpment world, completing Makers Academy's bootcamp at the end of Febuary 2016. My primary motivation to get into the field was to equip myself with the skills needed to fully realise the potential of my English Skype learning platform, [English Tutors Live](http://www.englishtutorslive.com). Having previously worked on the content side of digital marketing as a freelancer for businesses in Los Angeles, CA, I felt it important to develop hard skills to be able to make the leap to becoming a true growth hacker. 

Currently I am very open to new opportunities in which I can harness my previously developed skills in growing a business, while further developing my new tech skills. I am looking to be challenged by and learn from supportive, collaborative teammates in a friendly, creative and adventurous organisation.

## Skills

#### Detail-oriented, Creative Problem Solving

I greatly enjoy exploring potential solutions to problems by breaking them down into their simplest form and iteratively building the most succient solution using LEAN methodologies. 

- I am a logical, calm thinker. When multiple, potentially interesting options are available, I am able to assess their suitability in solving the initial problem. This lets me choose the best tools for the job.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. Working across time zones and languages requires considerable flexibility and persistence. I have found this mind-set very applicable to code.
- When facing a new problem, my first step and strongest ability is research. I especially excel at working in small teams to come up with creative solutions and ideas. Over my past experience working in SEO and marketing, I have developed excellent Google Foo, proficiency with Googling specific technical issues and implementing solutions.
- Solving a problem, especially if I am able to help someone else along the way, can be even more satisfying than everything working right the first time!

#### Clean code, make it work -> make it right 

Makers Academy has equipped me with a working knoledge of the very best practices in modern software development.

- Software development is not a solitary activity, but a team effort. I am a big fan of pair programming, which Makers Academy fully embraces as evidenced by the fact that throughout the course we were asked to pair with someone different every day. This helped me further develop strong teamworking and interpersonal skills in the context of coding.
- I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming, creating new systems using Behavior Driven Development, Test Driven Development and SOLID principles.
- At Makers, I learned that development should be seen as a craft. Using the red, green, refactor model, working code is just the first step, refactoring for simplicity and to allow other developers to understand and extend my code without resorting to modification is a key consideration.
- Most crucially, I have a great curiosity and passion for technology. I enjoy independent and exploratory learning as well as experimenting with new ideas and technologies as they arise in order to expand my skill set.
