## Richard Moss

An avid technologist, I have worked on a variety of projects with a diverse range of people, crossing technologies, languages, and continents, and thrive in leadership positions. As a speaker of five languages and counting, I've been told I'm a great communicator and motivating to work with.

Before my current role as principal engineer at [Sainsbury's Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sainsburysdtd), I worked in a diverse range of tech-oriented roles over the past ten years, including running trainings and coaching professional developers with [React GraphQL Academy](https://reactgraphql.academy/)(RGA). As an experienced software engineer, I have solid experience of full-stack engineering and retain a particular level of specialization in the front-end space. In particular working within the React ecosystem, I'm a proficient solution architect, having previously been the lead developer on several React projects such as Boston University’s renowned [AGNI journal](https://agnionline.bu.edu/) and, more recently, leading the front-end practices and architecture in the Supplier Experience domain at Sainsbury's Tech. My technical expertise and stack preference is React -> GraphQL -> MongoDB / Firebase -> Serverless (GCP || AWS), but I’m also skilled and have varied experience in many other libaries/frameworks in JavaScript and other languages including Ruby, Python, PHP, ReasonML (and I'm always curious to explore others). 

In my current role as a tech lead, I work both within and across teams, liasing with business stakeholders as well as product and XD teams to map requirements into scalable and maintainable technical solutions. In addition, I mentor several front-end engineers, organize and run knowledge-sharing sessions, and advocate for engineers and a tech-first approach within the wider business. I'm also passionate about interacting with and giving back to the wider developer community, and previously (before the pandemic) was heavily involved with running the [JavaScript Lisbon](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-Lisbon/) and [JavaScript London](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-London/) meetups in addition to speaking at events across Europe, such as the Netherlands, Croatia and Portugal, among others. I have also written content on Medium and the [RGA blog](https://reactgraphql.academy/blog/) in my free time, and have made some [video content on React Hooks](https://youtu.be/8ejtnaOxXQE). To reinforce my leadership and management experience, I also recently completed [Oxford University's Executive Leadership Program](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/executive-education/online-programmes/oxford-executive-leadership-programme) through the Saïd Business School.

I'm always open to new opportunities in which I can harness my skills in scaling and managing tech teams that underpin businesses, while further developing new tech skills. I love being challenged by and learning from supportive, collaborative teammates in a friendly, creative, and adventurous organisation. 



## Skills

#### Detail-oriented, Creative Problem Solving

I greatly enjoy exploring potential solutions to problems by breaking them down into their simplest form and iteratively building the most succinct solution using LEAN methodologies. 

- As a logical, calm thinker, when multiple, potentially interesting options are available, I am able to assess their suitability in solving the initial problem. This allows me to choose the best tools for the job.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. Working across time zones and languages, as well as managing teams working remotely, requires considerable flexibility and persistence. I have found this mind-set very applicable to both coding and team management.
- When facing a new problem, my first step and strongest ability is research. I especially excel at working with agile teams to come up with creative solutions and ideas. Over my past experience including in SEO and marketing, I have developed excellent Google Foo -- proficiency with Googling specific technical issues and implementing solutions.
- Solving a problem, especially if I am able to help someone else along the way, can be even more satisfying than everything working right the first time! 

#### Clean code, make it work -> make it right 

 My experience has equipped me with a working knowledge of best practices in modern software development.

- Software development is not a solitary activity, but a team effort. I am a big fan of pair programming, something I fully embrace, encouraging pairing with multiple team members (including developers, UX and product) during any given day. This has helped me further develop strong teamworking, communication and interpersonal skills in the context of coding and leadership.
- I am constantly looking to expand my technical knowledge, I'm a keen advocate of Functional Programming as a basis for software products, breaking down code into well-defined, performant and testable units. I'm also keen on a dev ops first approach, builing infrafstruture as code and harnessing CI/CD to deliver incremental value into production at pace.
- I believe that development should be seen as a craft. Using the red-green-refactor model as a guie, working code is just the first step. Refactoring for simplicity and to allow other developers to understand and extend code without resorting to modification is also a key consideration. Well-tested code is something I believe to be crucial in a production application with unit tests => integration tests => end-to-end tests implemented in all applications.
- Most crucially, I have a great curiosity and passion for technology. I enjoy independent and exploratory learning as well as experimenting with new ideas and technologies as they arise in order to expand my skill set. Recently I have been focused on further expanding my knowledge of functional programming and its practical implementations in JS applications, I've also been learning ReasonML and looking into Rust with an eye on the future as it has a complile story to WebAssembly.
