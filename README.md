## Richard Moss

An avid technologist, I thrive in leadership positions and have worked on a variety of projects with a diverse range of people, crossing technologies, languages, and continents. As a speaker of five languages and counting, I've been told I'm a great communicator and motivating to work with.

In my recent role as a Software Development Manager at [Zapp](https://tryzapp.com/), I led the consumer facing core team in developing and maintaing the native mobile application used by thousands of customers everyday.

My main focus as an engineering manager is to support and coach engineers both in my immediate team and across the domain through participatory leadership, liasing with business stakeholders as well as product and XD teams to map requirements into scalable and maintainable technical solutions. Bridging the gap between tech teams and non-technical stakeholders is a challenge I relish. Additionally I advocate for engineers and a tech-first, agile practices approach within the business.

To reinforce my leadership and management experience, in 2020 I completed [Oxford University's Executive Leadership Programme](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/executive-education/online-programmes/oxford-executive-leadership-programme) through the Oxford Saïd Business School.

I'm also passionate about giving back to the wider developer community, have been the co-organiser of the [JavaScript London](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-London/) meetup group since 2016. In addition I've presented tech talks and workshops at events across Europe such as [React Summit](https://remote.reactsummit.com/workshops-3h). I've contributed extensively over the past years to JavaScript and React educational content on both Medium and the [RGA blog](https://reactgraphqlacademy.web.app/blog/) in my spare time, and continue to run community workshops and events.

I'm always open to new opportunities in which I can harness my skills in managing and scaling tech teams that underpin businesses, while further developing new leadership and tech skills. I love being challenged by and learning from supportive, collaborative teammates in a friendly, creative, and ambitious organisation.

## Skills

#### Detail-oriented, Creative Problem Solving

I greatly enjoy exploring potential solutions to problems by breaking them down into their simplest form and iteratively building the most succinct solution using LEAN methodologies.

- As a logical, calm thinker, when multiple, potentially interesting options are available, I am able to assess their suitability in solving the initial problem. This allows me to choose the best tools for the job.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. Working across time zones and languages, as well as managing teams working remotely, requires considerable flexibility and persistence. I have found this mind-set very applicable to both coding and team management.
- When facing a new problem, my first step and strongest ability is research. I especially excel at working with agile teams to come up with creative solutions and ideas. Over my past experience including in SEO and marketing, I have developed excellent Google Foo -- proficiency with Googling specific technical issues and implementing solutions.
- Solving a problem, especially if I am able to help someone else along the way, can be even more satisfying than everything working right the first time!

#### Clean code, make it work -> make it right

My experience has equipped me with a working knowledge of best practices in modern software development.

- Software development is not a solitary activity, but a team effort. I am a big fan of pair programming, something I fully embrace, encouraging pairing with multiple team members (including developers, UX and product) during any given day. This has helped me further develop strong teamworking, communication and interpersonal skills in the context of coding and leadership.
- I am constantly looking to expand my technical knowledge, I'm a keen advocate of Functional Programming as a basis for software products, breaking down code into well-defined, performant and testable units. I'm also keen on a dev ops first approach, builing infrafstruture as code and harnessing CI/CD to deliver incremental value into production at pace.
- I believe that development should be seen as a craft. Using the red-green-refactor model as a guide, working code is just the first step. Refactoring for simplicity and to allow other developers to understand and extend code without resorting to modification is also a key consideration. Well-tested code is something I believe to be crucial in a production application with unit tests => integration tests => end-to-end tests implemented in all applications.
- Most crucially, I have a great curiosity and passion for technology. I enjoy independent and exploratory learning as well as experimenting with new ideas and technologies as they arise in order to expand my skill set. Recently I have been focused on further expanding my knowledge of functional programming and its practical implementations in JS applications, I've also been learning ReasonML and looking into Rust with an eye on the future as it has a complile story to WebAssembly.
