## Richard Moss

Digital Nomad and avid technologist, I have worked on a variety of projects with a diverse range of people, crossing both languages and continents. As a speaker of five languages and counting, I've been told I'm a great communicator and motivating to work with. 


As an entrepreneur passionate about teaching and mentoring, I founded an online English school in 2012, and since then jumped into the tech world as a software engineer in roles at a diverse range of startups before my current role running and coaching professional Developers with [React GraphQL Academy](https://reactgraphql.academy/). As a software engineer I have become highly specialized in the React ecosystem and confident as a solution architect, having been the lead developer on several React projects such as Boston University’s renowned [AGNI journal](https://agnionline.bu.edu/). My expertise and stack preference is React -> GraphQL -> MongoDB / Firebase -> Serverless (google cloud), but I’m also proficient and have experience in many others in both JavaScript and other languages including (Ruby, Python, PHP), and always looking to expand. The last couple of years I've been a lead coach and organizer of the public trainings of RGA in addition to delivering onsite training for professional devs at top companies, both coaching and advising developer leads on best practice patterns and implementations for React and its associated libraries. In addition to coaching and business development, I also lead the team on the build and technical implementation of both the branded site and materials for the in person courses. I've worked with and helped build a team spanning marketing/UX, sales, analytics and developers, while also mentoring multiple junior devs and running the coach community. I love giving back to the developer community and co-run the [JavaScript Lisbon](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-Lisbon/) and [JavaScript London](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-London/) meetup in addition to speaking at events across Europe, including in the Netherlands, Croatia and Portugal, among others. I also write content on Medium and RGA blog in my free time and have made some [video content on React Hooks](https://youtu.be/8ejtnaOxXQE).


I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations in which I can harness my previously developed skills in growing a business, while further developing my new tech skills. I love being challenged by and learning from supportive, collaborative teammates in a friendly, creative and adventurous organisation. 



## Skills

#### Detail-oriented, Creative Problem Solving

I greatly enjoy exploring potential solutions to problems by breaking them down into their simplest form and iteratively building the most succient solution using LEAN methodologies. 

- I am a logical, calm thinker. When multiple, potentially interesting options are available, I am able to assess their suitability in solving the initial problem. This lets me choose the best tools for the job.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. Working across time zones and languages requires considerable flexibility and persistence. I have found this mind-set very applicable to code.
- When facing a new problem, my first step and strongest ability is research. I especially excel at working in small teams to come up with creative solutions and ideas. Over my past experience working in SEO and marketing, I have developed excellent Google Foo, proficiency with Googling specific technical issues and implementing solutions.
- Solving a problem, especially if I am able to help someone else along the way, can be even more satisfying than everything working right the first time! 

#### Clean code, make it work -> make it right 

 My experience has equipped me with a working knowledge of best practices in modern software development.

- Software development is not a solitary activity, but a team effort. I am a big fan of pair programming, something that LeanJS and RGA fully embraces as pairing with multiple team members (both developers and others) during any given day. This helped me further develop strong teamworking and interpersonal skills in the context of coding and leadership.
- I am constantly looking to expand my technical knowledge, and I'm a keen advocate of Functional Programming as an approach, breaking down code in to well defined, performant and testable units.
- I believe that development should be seen as a craft. Using the red, green, refactor model, working code is just the first step, refactoring for simplicity and to allow other developers to understand and extend code without resorting to modification is a key consideration. Well tested code is something I believe to be crucial in a production application with unit tests => integration tests => end to end tests implemented in all applications.
- Most crucially, I have a great curiosity and passion for technology. I enjoy independent and exploratory learning as well as experimenting with new ideas and technologies as they arise in order to expand my skill set. Recently I have been focused on further expanding my knowledge of functional programming and it's practical implementations in JS appliactions, I've also been learning ReasonML and looking into Rust with an eye on the future as it has a complile story to WebAssembly.
